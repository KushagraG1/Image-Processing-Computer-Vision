# Image-Processing-Computer-Vision

# Objective
• To develop an ML model for image enhancement, processing and segmentation to solve real-world problems

# Approach
• Executed OpenCV to develop algorithms for accurate results in image enhancement, edge detection and segmentation
• Applied statistical modelling, probability analysis for image analysis, extracting features, and recognising patterns
• Leveraged ML algorithms (PyTorch) and deep learning architectures (CNNs) for precise image segmentation
• Integrated spatial and frequency domain techniques to effectively denoise images and extract essential features

# Outcome 
• Achieved optimum accuracy for image segmentation & enhancement, edge detection on different image categories
